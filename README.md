A simple platformer game, where you are a block. You can move around, and jump on the platforms, and reach checkpoints. This project was a course project from freeCodeCamps DSA JavaScript course. I added in additional features and fixed bugs on my own:

1. Fixed glitching under canvas when hitting platfrom from side when the platform is really low.
2. Added in side detection logic for the platforms, so that when the player hits one of the sides, it stops moving, instead of glitching through it.
3. Added detailed comments for each line of code, literally. I understood every single line of code that was written. By doing so, I actually learn how to solve problems, and how the code works, instead of falling into tutorial hell. That allowed me to fix the two bugs mentioned above.
